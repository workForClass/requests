// 1. create a variable called isRaining and assign it a value of true

// 2. create a new Promise and assign it to a constant called birthdayParty
    // when isRaining is true, the promise should resolve and output a venue object 
    // with local: centennial park and friends: 30 key value pairs
    // hint: you may need to set up a venue object before you call resolve that you will pass in as an argument
    
    // when its not true, the promise should reject and output an error message "sorry, you have to have an in house party"
    // hint: you may need to set up a new Error before you call reject that you will pass in as an argument

// 3. Consume our promise! 
    // create a function called checkWeather
    // this function should chain a .then to your birthdayParty variable
    // once the promise has been reached, it should output the resolve message
    // insert a catch for error that displays the error's message

// call your function and make sure it works :)
